name: musicbrainz-mcp
description: Search and browse the MusicBrainz music encyclopedia (artists, releases, recordings, labels, works), fetch Cover Art Archive images, resolve musicbrainz.org URLs, and — with OAuth configured — submit your own tags, ratings, and collection edits. Use when the user asks about music metadata, discographies, album/artist/recording details, MBIDs, cover art, or wants to tag/rate music on MusicBrainz.

# MusicBrainz

This server exposes the [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org) `/ws/2` API and the Cover Art Archive as MCP tools. Reads need no credentials; writes need OAuth (see the repo README).

## Picking the right tool

- **Find something by name** → `musicbrainz_search` with `entity` + a Lucene `query` (+ `view?`). Plain text matches the name; fielded queries work too (`artist:"Miles Davis" AND country:US`). Returns MBIDs.
- **Get full detail for a known MBID** → `musicbrainz_lookup` with `entity` + `mbid` (+ `view?`). Add `inc` for linked data, e.g. `["releases","release-groups"]` on an artist, `["recordings","labels"]` on a release, `["url-rels","tags"]` on most entities.
- **Enumerate a relationship** → `musicbrainz_browse`: every release by an artist (`entity:"release", linkedBy:"artist", mbid:<artist>`), recordings on a release, releases in a collection, etc. Takes `view?` too. This is the complete paged set (max 100/page), unlike search's fuzzy ranking.
- **Cover art** → `musicbrainz_cover_art` with a release or release-group MBID. Returns image URLs (front/back/thumbnails); errors clearly when none exist.
- **A pasted musicbrainz.org link** → `musicbrainz_resolve` with the `url` (+ `view?`).
- **Check it's working** → `musicbrainz_healthcheck`.

`view?` is optional everywhere it appears and defaults to `compact` — see [Response shape](#response-shape-view).

## Typical flow

Search to get an MBID, then lookup/browse for detail:

1. `musicbrainz_search { entity: "artist", query: "Radiohead" }` → MBID
2. `musicbrainz_browse { entity: "release-group", linkedBy: "artist", mbid: <MBID>, limit: 100 }` → discography
3. `musicbrainz_cover_art { entity: "release-group", mbid: <RG-MBID> }` → album art

## Writes (OAuth, confirm-gated)

`musicbrainz_submit_tags`, `musicbrainz_submit_rating`, and `musicbrainz_modify_collection` modify the user's own MusicBrainz account. Each returns a **dry-run preview** unless called with `confirm: true` — show the preview to the user and only re-call with `confirm: true` after they approve. They require `MUSICBRAINZ_OAUTH_*` to be configured.

## Response shape (`view`)

`musicbrainz_lookup`, `musicbrainz_search`, `musicbrainz_browse` and
`musicbrainz_resolve` take `view: "compact" | "full"`, and **`compact` is the
default** — you get the slim shape without asking, and an unrecognised value
falls back to it rather than erroring.

**Compact here is media stripping, not a field projection.** It removes keys
named like a picture — `image`, `images`, `thumbnail`/`thumbnails`, `logo`,
`icon`, `banner`, `avatar`, and their `…Url`/`…Link`/`…Uri`/`…Src` spellings —
plus any string value that is a URL ending in an image extension. Nothing else
is touched. This server keeps **no** hand-written field list, deliberately:
there is no captured fixture of a MusicBrainz payload here, so nothing could
honestly say which of its fields are noise, and an invented list would hand you
a record with holes in it that reads like a verified answer. Do not expect
compact to name the fields it kept — it kept all of them.

**The consequence that will surprise you: on most calls compact and full come
back identical.** MusicBrainz's `/ws/2` JSON carries almost no pictures — they
live in the Cover Art Archive, behind `musicbrainz_cover_art`, which has no
`view` at all. A release's `cover-art-archive` block survives compact whole
(`artwork`, `count`, `front`, `back`): those are facts about the art, not the
art, and none of those keys is a picture name.

The one place compact does bite is `inc: ["url-rels"]`. The bare-image-URL rule
matches on the *value*, not the key, so a relation whose target ends in
`.jpg`/`.png` comes back as `url: { id }` with its **`resource` gone**, while
the wikidata relation beside it keeps its `resource` untouched. If you are
chasing image relations, ask for `view: "full"`.

`view: "full"` returns MusicBrainz's payload untouched. One shape note:
`musicbrainz_resolve` wraps it as `{entity, mbid, data}` — `data` is the lookup
payload verbatim — because resolve *is* `musicbrainz_lookup` with the MBID
parsed out of a URL, and answering it in a different shape would make the
response depend on which of two identical routes you took.

There is deliberately **no `raw` rung**. Nothing is rewritten on the way out
here, so `full` already *is* the unprojected upstream payload; a third value
would silently alias it. `view` is also never forwarded to MusicBrainz — it is
consumed by this server, not added to the query string.

The other five tools take no `view`, for three different reasons:

- **`musicbrainz_cover_art`** — its product IS the image URLs. Compact strips
  `images`/`thumbnails`, which on this tool would not shrink the response, it
  would empty it.
- **`musicbrainz_healthcheck`** — `{ok, reachable, oauth_configured, hint}` is
  already narrower than any projection.
- **`musicbrainz_submit_tags` / `musicbrainz_submit_rating` /
  `musicbrainz_modify_collection`** — a write's response is a receipt (the
  dry-run preview, or `{submitted, …}`): nothing to strip and everything to
  keep.

## Notes

- MusicBrainz limits clients to ~1 request/second; the server paces itself, so a big browse may take a few seconds — that's expected, not an error.
- Entity types: `area artist event genre instrument label place recording release release-group series work url`.
